# Logic-Gate-Design-and-Verification
Designed and simulated logic gates (Inverter, Nand3) using XCircuit, Magic, and IRSIM. Verified accuracy through layout vs schematic (LVS) checks and analyzed performance with analog simulations.

**Tools used**
1. Schematic Capture - XCircuit
2. Layout Design and DRC - Magic   
3. LVS - Netgen
4. Functional verification - IRsim
5. Analog simulation - Ngspice
